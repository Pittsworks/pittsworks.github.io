  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>PittsWorks is a public notebook and blueprint library about modern work.</p>

  <p>I write from the thick of it, where governance meets reality, systems shape behaviour, and leadership is tested in the small moments. These are real stories, paired with practical blueprints for designing better structures.</p>

  <p>My focus is simple: design better modern work through clarity, accountability, and systems that actually hold.</p>
