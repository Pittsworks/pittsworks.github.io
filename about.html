  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>PittsWorks is a public notebook and blueprint library about modern work.</p>

  <p>From the thick of it — where governance meets reality, systems shape behaviour, and leadership is tested in the small moments. Real stories, paired with practical blueprints for designing better structures.</p>

  <p>My focus is simple: design better modern work through clarity, accountability, and systems that actually hold.</p>
