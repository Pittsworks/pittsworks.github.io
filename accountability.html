  <h1>Where accountability disappears</h1>
  <p><em>By Pitts</em></p>

  <p>I knew something was off before anyone said it out loud.</p>

  <p>The framework was complete. Roles were defined. Reporting cycles were documented. On paper, governance looked intact. The structure existed. The language was precise. The rhythm of meetings was agreed.</p>

  <p>But when the question of ownership surfaced, the room shifted.</p>

  <p>Not dramatically. Quietly.</p>

  <p>“Who’s ultimately responsible for this?”</p>

  <p>There was a pause. Not long enough to be awkward. Just long enough to reveal something.</p>

  <p>No one stepped forward.</p>

  <p>That was the moment I understood something about modern work. Governance does not usually fail loudly. It erodes quietly. It dissolves into shared responsibility that belongs to everyone and therefore no one.</p>

  <p>The failure wasn’t a lack of effort. It wasn’t apathy. Everyone in the room cared. Everyone was competent. The problem was structural.</p>

  <p>Responsibility had been distributed without precision. Authority had been implied but not anchored. Reporting existed, but consequence did not. The system assumed clarity would emerge naturally from collaboration.</p>

  <p>It didn’t.</p>

  <p>I’ve seen this pattern more than once. We design frameworks that look complete because they contain all the parts. Roles. Cadence. Documentation. Escalation pathways. But we underestimate one thing: behavioural design.</p>

  <p>People respond to visibility. To ownership. To consequence. When those elements are soft, accountability becomes interpretive.</p>

  <p>In modern work, ambiguity doesn’t sit still. It spreads.</p>

  <p>That meeting gave me clarity. Not frustration. Clarity. I could see the exact design flaw. We had optimised for inclusivity of responsibility instead of precision of ownership.</p>

  <p>If I were designing that governance model today, ownership would be singular and visible. Reporting would trigger defined action. Authority would match responsibility. And every recurring forum would begin with one clear question: who owns the outcome?</p>

  <p>Modern work is not broken. It is often simply under-designed.</p>

  <p>And when accountability disappears, it’s rarely because people failed. It’s because structure did.</p>
