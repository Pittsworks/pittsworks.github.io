  <h1>Design for cognition, not decoration</h1>
  <p><em>By Pitts</em></p>

  <p>I’ve watched organisations invest heavily in redesigning digital platforms. New imagery. Rotating banners. Interactive web parts. The assumption is consistent: if it looks modern, it will feel engaging.</p>

  <p>But the real challenge in modern work isn’t visual boredom. It’s cognitive overload.</p>

  <p>Modern environments are dense. Multiple tools. Multiple channels. Constant notifications. Competing priorities. By the time someone lands on a page, they are already mentally full.</p>

  <p>Adding more visual stimulation doesn’t reduce that load. It often increases it.</p>

  <p>Engagement is not a movement problem. It’s a clarity problem.</p>

  <p>When everything moves, nothing stands still long enough to be understood.<br>
  When every element is highlighted, hierarchy collapses.<br>
  When every page tries to impress, users have to work harder to interpret it.</p>

  <p>Good design reduces thinking effort.</p>

  <p>It guides attention.<br>
  It sequences information.<br>
  It removes friction.<br>
  It respects mental capacity.</p>

  <p>In modern work, clarity is a performance tool. It allows people to act quickly because they do not have to decode structure first.</p>

  <p>This is not an argument against imagery or modern components. It is an argument for restraint.</p>

  <p>If I were designing digital environments for modern work today, I would prioritise reduction before addition. Clear headings. Predictable layouts. Logical grouping. Fewer competing elements.</p>

  <p>Engagement is not created by decoration. It is created by making it easy to understand what matters.</p>

  <p>Modern work is already complex. Our design choices should make it lighter, not louder.</p>
